# Design-of-Electromechanical-Systems-Spring17-Project
This repository contains project report and supporting code submitted in spring 17 for meeting the requirements of MAE 535: Design of Electromechanical Systems course taken by Dr. Gregory Buckner at NC State University.

My role in the project was performing design optimization using genetic algorithm, running a 2D simulation of the magnetic circuit (FEMM) and preparing the project report.
